    "* **Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of medical malpractice claims to identify trends, risk factors, and correlations between various variables. The goal is to provide insights that can help reduce the frequency and severity of medical malpractice claims, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\n",

    "    - Background and Significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical malpractice claims are a significant concern in the healthcare industry, resulting in substantial financial costs and emotional distress for patients, families, and healthcare providers. According to recent studies, the annual cost of medical malpractice in the United States is estimated to be $55.6 billion, accounting for 2.4% of annual healthcare spending. Furthermore, a staggering 7.4% of physicians licensed in the US face malpractice claims each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the most common specialties and procedures associated with medical malpractice claims?\n",
    "2. Are there any correlations between claim severity, patient age, and physician specialty?\n",
    "3. Do patients represented by private attorneys tend to receive higher claim payments?\n",
    "4. Are there any differences in claim outcomes based on patient demographics, such as gender and marital status?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring these questions and analyzing the dataset, this project seeks to provide valuable insights that can inform healthcare policy, medical practice, and patient safety initiatives.\n",
