## 💭 Background Context

This project explores a large dataset of **medical malpractice claims** to uncover:

- ✨ Patterns in the claims
- ✨ Risk factors associated with higher claim amounts
- ✨ Insights that could improve healthcare outcomes & reduce costs

👩‍⚕️ Data comes from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/medical-malpractice-insurance-dataset?resource=download) and contains over **79,000 records**.

---

## 🧁 Importing Packages

We used the cutest and most powerful tools:

- `pandas`, `numpy` – for wrangling that data like a boss 👑  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for plotting gorge visuals  
- `sklearn` – for modeling magic (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more)

---

## 📦 Data Collection & Description

💾 Source: Kaggle  
📏 Size: 79,210 records  
📚 Types: Mix of categorical and numerical data  
🧠 Features: State, Medical Specialty, Claim Amount, and more!

---

## 🧼 Data Loading & Cleaning

We:
- Loaded the CSV into a cute pandas DataFrame 📂  
- Explored its structure using `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- Cleaned up missing data and prepped it for modeling 🧹

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We did a **fabulous deep dive** into the data with:

- 🎨 Colorful bar plots and distributions
- 💡 Correlation heatmaps
- 📈 Trend analysis for claim types and regions

All plots were made to slay — beauty *and* brains. 💅

---

## 🤖 Modeling

We tried out different models to predict claim amounts:

- **Linear Regression** (classic and chic 👠)  
- **Random Forest Regressor** (powerful and bold 🌳)  
- **Ridge, Lasso & ElasticNet** (for that regularized realness)

We also evaluated them using:
- RMSE
- MAE
- R² Score

📊 Results were compared to find the best-performing model!

---

## 🌟 Conclusions

✨ Key risk factors identified  
✨ Modeling revealed actionable insights  
✨ This analysis can help reduce malpractice risks and improve patient care 💖

---

## 🌸 How to Run It

1. Clone this repo or download the notebook  
2. Open it in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**  
3. Run the cells from top to bottom  
4. Sit back and enjoy the sparkle of data magic ✨
